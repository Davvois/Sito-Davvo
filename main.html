        <strong class="First-Paragraph">Hi there! I'm Davvo, you can call me David too. I'm 14, I currently live in Italy and programming is my thing. <br><br> I work with languages like Java, C, HTML, and Python. I've been into programming since I was a kid, though I haven't taken on a big project yet. <br><br> I've gone from making Java plugins for Minecraft to trying my hand at a Unity game (let's just say it's a "game" for now), and even building websites. <br><br> By the way, I also bought Dennis Ritchie's book about C, infact I'm really trying to learn C as my main programming language. :D</strong>
